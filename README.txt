If experiencing errors running DataAnalyzer.jar, this may be due to the
.jar being compiled and generated on a different version of Java than
the current computer. To fix this, the program should be recompiled
and generated on the current computer. Running build.bat via command prompt
or double-clicking build.bat should generate a new DataAnalyzer.jar.
